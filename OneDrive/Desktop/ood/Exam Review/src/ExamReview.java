  /**
   * Problem --> Solution
   * ====================
   * to construct an object by name ---> factory
   * to construct a customizable object ---> builder
   * to deduplicate code between classes ---> abstract classes
   * to choose how to do something at run time ---> strategy
   *        - INPUTS -> OUTPUTS
   * to perform actions by responding to outside events ---> callback
   * to perform actions by name ---> command design pattern
   * to mimic an existing component to write tests ---> mocks
   * to reuse existing code ---> inheritance/composition
   *      - inheritance reuses implementation, composition reuses interface
   *      - inheritance allows access to protected fields/methods/etc.
   *      - if a class is final, the only way to reuse code is composition
   *  to expose only what is necessary ---> encapsulation/information hiding/access modifiers
   *  to make a guarantee about a property of the class ---> class invariants
   *      1. it is a statement that is true or false
   *      To be an invariant, it MUST be true.
   *      2. about the instantaneous state of an object: if i stop the program and look at the object's fields
   *      I can say if the statement is true or false
   *      3. ensured in the constructor
   *      4. preserved by the methods --> if true before method, must be true after the method
   *      NOTE: it can't be something that is obviously true
   *        - no tautologies
   *        - nothing ensured by the language
   *
