  /**
   * Invariants are logical statements about the instantaneous state of an object that
   * is ensured by the constructors and preserved by the methods.
   * 1. A logical statement is a claim that is true or false.
   * 2. The instantaneous state of an object is the combination of values
   * of all its fields at some point in time.
   * 3. The invariant is ensured by constructors in the sense that whenever
   * a public constructor returns, the logical statement holds.
   * 4. Preserving the logical statement that the method doesn't introduce nonsense
   * - instead, we know that if given an object in a good state then it will leave the
   * object in a good state as well.
